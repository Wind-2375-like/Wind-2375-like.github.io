How can I connect to a server that only allows specific ip (e.g. lab intranet) logins without connecting to this specific ip?

If you connect to another server that can connect to your real target server, you can set this server up as a jump machine.

## Generate ssh public/private rsa key pair (Windows)

(Git bash)

```shell
cd ~/.ssh
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

## Upload public key to target machine and jump machine (Windows)

(Git bash)

```shell
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub [jump_machine]@[jump_machine_ip]
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub [target_machine]@[target_machine_ip]
```

## Edit ~/.ssh/config

```python
Host JumpMachine
  HostName [jump_machine_ip]
  User [jump_machine]
  IdentityFile "C:\Users\[name]\.ssh\id_rsa"

Host TargetMachine
  HostName [target_machine_ip]
  User [target_machine]
  IdentityFile "C:\Users\[name]\.ssh\id_rsa"
  ProxyCommand ssh -W %h:%p JumpMachine
```

## On Vscode ssh
