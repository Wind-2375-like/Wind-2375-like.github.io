Hi everyone~ I am Yiyang Feng (å†¯ä¹™æ´‹), an MSc student in computer science at EPFL ([MSCS@EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/ic/education/master/computer-science/)). Previously, I received my B.S. degree in Automation at [Xi'an Jiaotong University](https://en.xjtu.edu.cn/) (XJTU) in July 2022.

I love Natural Language Processing (NLP)! Previously, I have worked in these fields:

- Text Generation
- GNNs and their explainability for NLP
- Text-to-SQL

I am interested in diving deeper and exploring more areas of NLP. ðŸ˜„

I would like to thank all the people who gave me advice on my research and application, especially:

- My father and mother who support me whatever decisions I have made.
- Prof. [Rui Zhang](https://ryanzhumich.github.io/) who was my advisor during the summer internship at PSU NLP Lab: He is a very expert at NLP and DL. He also gave me insightful advice on my research and helped me a lot with my application. I am very fortunate to have such an excellent professor who cares about students.
- [Chengzu Li](https://www.linkedin.cn/incareer/in/chengzu-li-111762226?trk=public_profile_samename-profile) who was the collaborator of my second research project *Joint Entity and Relationship Extraction from Social Media Texts*: He also gave me many valuable suggestions on research and MSCS application.
- Prof. [Xiaoming Liu](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/xm.liu) who was my advisor on my second research project and [Zhongmin Cai](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/zmcai/english-version) who was my first research advisor: They gave me the opportunity to know more about NLP.
- Other students sharing information about research, studying abroad, and the application process: Hao Wang, Wenqing Wang, Yueming Zhu, Zhehao Gu, Yang Zhang, Yitao Shi, and Shiqi Xia.
- My main collaborators of various course projects: Jie Cheng, Shiqi Xia, Keli Deng, Jinghan He, Hongxuan Yu, and Jianyu Duan.

P.S. I have an alias: "wind_like" because the pronunciation of my name å†¯ä¹™æ´‹ (Feng Yiyang, family name is in the front) is similar to é£Žä¸€æ · (just like wind). I'm a wind-like person. ðŸ˜‚ Sometimes I add "2375" between "wind" and "like" because 2375 is the [GB 2312 code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GB_2312) for my family name å†¯ (Feng).
