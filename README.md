> This is my personal webpage forked from [`hexo-theme-fluid`](https://hexo.fluid-dev.com/).

[Browse](https://wind-2375-like.github.io)

The blog is based on hexo + hexo-theme-fluid and it is deployed via github pages + hexo-deployer-git and modified to customize the domain name.

Acknowledgment:

Thanks for the [tutorial](http://ericwu.cn/2020/05/01/my-new-blog/) (written in Chinese)! It is really helpful.

TODO:

- Build a dialogue system in the kanbanmuseum. (May never achieve)
- Sticky posts.

**Updated on Jul. 10, 2022**

- Removed everything and chose [`hexo-fluid`](https://hexo.fluid-dev.com/) as the new theme.

I used to write my blogs [HERE](https://www.cnblogs.com/wind2375like/) (*cnblog*), but I have switched to Github Page because:

- It is a website for Chinese language blogs and does not support English UI (not friendly to people all over the world).
- It is SLOW to access the website from abroad.
- *Cnblog* will block some 'dangerous' words. I don't want my words in my personal site changed because of that.
- *Cnblog* will block some of my blogs irrelevant to CS.
- I can only push a limited number of blogs to *Cnblog* in a short time.
